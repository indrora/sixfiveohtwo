# SixFiveOhTwo: An experiment in Vibe Coding. 

This is an experiment in ML-assisted development: I wanted a simple 6502 emulator. 
So used Claude to generate the vast majority of the code, plus an assembler, plus
some additional tools. 

This has not been tested at all. 

Caveat Emptor, Caveat Erector.
